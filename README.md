## Microwave ##

Some quick things to notice with the microwave is that there are a large number of buttons. Some of the buttons aren't necessarily intuitive off a quick glance. 

## Example of Operation ##

One of the main issues with this microwave is that if a person wanted to quickly just do a 7 minute cook time they would not be able to. Buttons 7,8,9,0 do not work unless cook time is selected first. This can throw people off at first. Another issue with the microwave is the express cook feature. Selecting buttons 1-6 will instantly start the microwave. This feature is not bad necessarily but why stop at button 6? Make it for all of the buttons except 0.

## Defrost ##

Another issue with this microwave is the text speed. For example, when doing defrost the text moves extremely show and also it asks for the weight of the food that you are defrosting. It takes far too long to notify the user that it is requesting the weight.

The microwave makes some of these options fairly easy like warming food and liquids but for the other use cases they are less intuitive. For example if I want to fine tune the some of the settings like setting power to 50% it takes too many presses and the text moves too slow. Also, there is not an indicator that indicates that the power is actually changed. Some of the things that need to be improved the most with this microwave is the user feedback, text speed, and ease of use.
