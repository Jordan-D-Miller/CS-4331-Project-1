#Microwave

Some quick things to notice with the microwave is that there are a large number of buttons. Some of the buttons aren't necessarily intuitive off a quick glance.

One of the main issues with this microwave is that if a person wanted to quickly just do a 7 minute cook time they would not be able to. Buttons 7,8,9,0 do not work unless cook time is selected first. This can throw people off at first. Another issue with the microwave is the express cook feature. Selecting buttons 1-6 will instantly start the microwave. This feature is not bad necessarily but why stop at button 6? Make it for all of the buttons except 0.
